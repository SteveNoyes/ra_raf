## Overview

### Notes 

Database of everyone that will be signing in. 

When they sign in they will be in their own prize selection area.

Each person gets 15 tickets. 

There will be 27 prizes.

Each person can put as many of their tickets into any prize they want.
  if they select a prize their ticket count goes down.

All ticket selections get an ID number so you know whos they are.

The raffle is drawn for each prize. All the tickets for each prize will be drawn from and reduced down to one. 

Make a GUI for selection and drawing.
